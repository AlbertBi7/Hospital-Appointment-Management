## Introduction

- **Brief overview of the project:**
  This mini-project is designed to book appointments for users with the doctors they need. The interface allows the user to create a file with their basic details, 
  such as name, address, and age. Each patient file is accessed with the help of a Patient Identity Number (PIN). The user can either book an appointment and check 
  their appointment or make a follow-up with their previous doctor.
- **Problem statement:**
 The projext aims to implement a system for patients to book appointments with doctors, manage scheduling, and display availability.

- **Objective:**
  This mini-project is designed to streamline the process of booking appointments with doctors in a hospital setting.This project aims to provide an efficient, user-friendly interface for both patients and hospital staff to manage appointments.

  - RAM: 4GB or higher
  - Hard Disk: 100MB of free space
  - Display: 800x600 resolution or higher

- **Software requirements:**
  - Operating System: Windows, macOS, or Linux
  - Compiler: GCC (GNU Compiler Collection)
  - Text Editor: Any code editor such as VS Code or Notepad++

## Design and Development

- **Description of program logic:**
  - The programme consists of the main function and five user-defined functions.The main function provides the choices of tasks that the programme can perform. Mainly, book an appointment, check an appointment, and book a follow-up.
  - If the choice is to book an appointment, then it will ask if you already have an existing file in the hospital. If yes, then you can enter the patient identity number and access the patient file. If you don’t have an existing file in the hospital, you can create a new one by entering your name, age, and address.
  - After accessing the file, you will be provided with the names of the names of the doctors present in the hospital, and you can choose which doctor you want to book an appointment with. You can enter the date you want to book an appointment on, and it will return if the doctor is available or not. If the doctor is available, then you can confirm the booking, or else you can enter another date to check if they are not available.
  - If the choice chosen is to check an appointment, then you are asked to enter your PIN and check your appointments.
  - If the choice is to follow up, then you can enter the PIN and book a follow-up with the doctor you want on the date they are available.
## Summary

These kind of systems allow the  users to easily book, check, and manage their medical appointments through a user-friendly interface, reducing the need for time-consuming phone calls or in-person visits. The program provides up-to-date information on doctor availability, allowing patients to choose the most convenient times for their appointments and making the scheduling process more flexible.This Hospital Appointment System stands out by prioritizing both patient convenience and healthcare provider efficiency, ultimately leading to improved patient satisfaction and better healthcare outcomes.
